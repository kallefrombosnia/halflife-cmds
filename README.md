This data is fork of [github.com/txdv/cstrike-cvarlist](https://github.com/txdv/cstrike-cvarlist)  

## Why another project on same data?
Main page contains search bar which can be easily used to find commands and this project will be updated with new cvars and updates on old ones. 

Index page is built with skeleton css framework (props to them) and jQuery.
